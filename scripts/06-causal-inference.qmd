## Two Cultures

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(gt)

eu <- read_rds("../data/buzzwords.rds")
```

-   Statistical modeling used for two things:

    -   Predictive modeling

    -   Explanative modeling/Causal Inferece

{{< newline >}}

-   Causal inference (IMHO) is much harder than prediction, because it [relies on information not included in our data]{.highlight}.

{{< newline >}}

-   No sure way to do it, causal inference is an unsolved problem.

-   Doing causal inference can be uncomfortable, but the benefits are great.

## Goal of Causal Inference

-   We are interested in what happens with variable $Y$ if variable $X$ changes.

-   In a way, we are [predicting an alternative reality]{.highlight}, where everything is the same, except for the value of $X$.

{{< newline >}}

-   *How would math skill change if we started using project based learning?*

-   *How likely would be people be to purchase a product, if they were offered a sale?*

-   *What would the GDP of Czechia be, if we never entered the European Union?*

## Gender & Wages

-   We are interested in the effect of gender on wages.

```{r}
tribble(~name, ~gender, ~wages_man, ~wages_women,
        "Scott",  "Man",   "32 000 CZK", "-",
        "Ramona", "Woman", "-",           "31 000 CZK",
        "Wallace","Man",   "36 000 CZK", "-",
        "Kim",    "Woman", "-",           "35 000 CZK",
        "Niel",   "Man",   "34 000 CZK", "-",
        "Knives", "Woman", "-",           "33 000 CZK") |> 
  gt() |> 
  cols_label("name" = md("**Name**"),
             "gender" = md("**Gender**"),
             "wages_man" = md("**Wages as man**"),
             "wages_women" = md("**Wages as woman**")) |> 
  tab_options(table.width = pct(100),
              table.background.color = "#FFF0C1",
              table.font.size = "25px") |> 
  opt_row_striping(row_striping = TRUE) |> 
  opt_vertical_padding(scale = 2)
```

-   What's the problem?

# It is [impossible to observe both the presence and the absence of treatment]{.highlight} on individual level at the same time.

## The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference

-   We can never know what the effect of some event is on individual level.
-   But there are ways to [estimate causal effects on group level]{.highlight}!
-   All strategies for causal inference are trying to solve/circumvent the [fundamental problem of causal inference]{.highlight}.

## Estimand

-   Theoretical quantity of interest

-   The number we want to get an unbiased estimate of of.

{{< newline >}}

{{< newline >}}

-   Lundberg, I., Johnson, R., & Stewart, B. M. (2021). [What Is Your Estimand? Defining the Target Quantity Connects Statistical Evidence to Theory]{.highlight}. *American Sociological Review*, *86*(3), 532--565. <https://doi.org/10.1177/00031224211004187>

## The life cycle of estimands

![Lundberg et al., 2021](images/estimands-lifecycle.jpeg){fig-align="center"}

## Theory or general goal

-   Source of the research question.

{{< newline >}}

{{< newline >}}

-   *Is attending pre-election debates worth it to politicians?*

-   *Is the police unfair towards minorities?*

-   *Is having children economically beneficial?*

-   *Would we make more money by selling our products at lower price?*

-   *Is being a woman disadvantageous in academia?*

## Theoretical estimand

-   Two parts:

    -   Unit specific quantity

    -   Target population of interest

-   [Unit specific quantity]{.highlight}

    -   The number that will represent the effect of interest.

    -   Should be clear, if we are after causal effects or correlations.

-   [Target population of interest]{.highlight}

    -   What population are we generalizing to.

## Theoretical estimands: Example

-   Research question: *Is attending pre-election debates worth it to politicians?*

-   Important and interesting question, but very vague.

-   More focused one: What's the effect of watching a pre-election debate on the perspective voters?

{{< newline >}}

-   We need two things: a) Unit specific quantity & b) Target population of interest

## Unit specific quantity

```{r}
tribble(~estimand, ~advantage, ~disadvantage,
        "Difference in probability of voting for a candidate, if voter saw vs didn't see the pre-election debate", "Super relavent to both base and applied research.", "We can't directly observe voting patterns for individuals",
        "Difference in probability of reported vote for a candidate, if voter saw vs didn't see the pre-election debate", "Reported votes can be easily observed", "Reported and actual votes are not the same",
        "Difference in logits of reported vote for a candidate, if voter saw t vs didn't see he pre-election debate", "lol", "Getting unbiased estimates for logits is super hard",
        "Difference in reported preferences on 5-point likert scale for a candidate, if voter saw vs didn't see the pre-election debate", "More granular measurment", "Likert scales less intuitive") |> 
  gt() |> 
  cols_label("estimand" = md("**Estimand**"),
             "advantage" = md("**Advantage**"),
             "disadvantage" = md("**Disadvantage**")) |> 
  tab_options(table.width = pct(100),
              table.background.color = "#FFF0C1",
              table.font.size = "25px") |> 
  opt_row_striping(row_striping = TRUE) |> 
  opt_vertical_padding(scale = 2)
```

## Target population of interest

-   Multiple options:

{{< newline >}}

-   Population of TV viewers.

-   Population of likely voters in Czechia.

-   Population of voters in Czechia.

-   Population of voters.

## Theoretical Estimands: Other Examples

```{r}
tribble(~question, ~estimand, ~population,
        "Is being a felon worse for blacks than for whites?", "Difference in whether application would be called back if it signaled
White with a felony vs. Black without", "Applications to jobs in Milwaukee", 
"Is police more likely to target minorities?", "Difference in whether person i would be stopped if perceived as Black vs. White", "Those stopped by police", 
"Does having rich parents increases income in adulthood?", "Adult income that person i would be realized if childhood income took a particular value", "U.S. population") |> 
  gt() |> 
  cols_label("question" = md("**Reseach question**"),
             "estimand" = md("**Unit specific quantity**"),
             "population" = md("**Target population of interest**")) |> 
  tab_options(table.width = pct(100),
              table.background.color = "#FFF0C1",
              table.font.size = "25px") |> 
  opt_row_striping(row_striping = TRUE) |> 
  opt_vertical_padding(scale = 2)
```

## Empirical Estimand

{{< newline >}}

-   The [difference in expected probability of voting]{.highlight} for candidate for voters who saw vs didn't see the debate.

-   $P(vote = x|debate= 1) - P(vote = x|debate= 0)$

{{< newline >}}

-   The [difference in means on 5-point likert scale]{.highlight} for voters who saw vs didn't see the debate

-   $E(Y|debate = 1) - E(Y|debate = 0)$

{{< newline >}}

-   The [difference in means on 5-point likert scale]{.highlight} for voters who saw vs didn't see the debate, [conditional on variables $X$]{.highlight}.

-   $E(Y|debate = 1, X) - E(Y|debate = 0, X)$

## Estimation strategy

-   The stuff we are going to talk about for the rest of the semester.

{{< newline >}}

-   Linear regression

-   Propensity score matching

-   Difference-in-differences

-   Fixed effects

## Estimands, Estimators, Estimates

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   At the beginning, you need to define two things:

    -   What you are estimating (unit specific quantity)

    -   For which population (target population of interest)

-   Then you define how to represent it mathematically (Empirical Estimand)

-   Then you define a strategy to get the estimate.

# Rubin's Potential Outcomes Framework

# Potential Outcomes

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Developed by Donald Rubin & bros.

-   The OG framework for causal inference.

-   Most of [natural/technical sciences are based on it]{.highlight}.

-   Basis for experimental design
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![The man, the myth, the legend](images/rubin.jpg){fig-align="right"}
:::

## Potential Outcomes

-   Potential outcome - [outcome given a value of treatment]{.highlight}.

    -   Income if male vs Income if female
    
-   [Treatment]{.highlight} - the focal independent variable

{{< newline >}}

-   We cannot observe individual effects.

-   But (under certain conditions), we can observe the [average treatment effect]{.highlight}!


## PO Framework's Assumptions

-   Two primary assumptions:

    -   Ignorability

    -   SUTVA
    
    
{{< newline >}}

- If both are true, the estimated value represents unbiased estimate of the average treatment effect.

## Ignorability

-   The [probability of receiving treatment has to be independent of the potential outcomes]{.highlight}.

-   Simpler: The probability of being in treatment group shouldn't be dependent on outcome.

    {{< newline >}}

-   Broken when:

    -   *Schools with high rate of bullying are more likely to receive anti-bullying training.*

    -   *People more susceptible to change voting preferences are more likely to see pre-election debates.*

## SUTVA

-   Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption.

-   Two-parter:

    -   [Everyone receives the same treatment]{.highlight}.

    -   [One unit/respondent receiving treatment doesn't influence others]{.highlight}.

{{< newline >}}

-   Broken when:

    -   *Teacher who received anti-bullying training starts teaching their colleagues.*

    -   *People who saw the debate starts to talk with people who didn't.*

## Potential Outcomes - Example

-   Nonprofit supporting the European Union.

-   Communication experts think framing messages as "European" is more effective than framing as "EU".

-   We want to test this empirically.

{{< newline >}}

-   How to do it?

## EU Communication - Estimand

-   Survey experiment

-   Formulate a set of statements

<!-- -->

-   Unit specific quantity:
    -   The probability of agreeing with statement, given that "Europe" is used instead of "EU".
-   Target population of interest
    -   Adult population of Czechia.

## EU Communication - Statements

```{r}
tribble(~item, ~label,
        "1", "Spolupráce v [Evroské unii/Evropě] je výhodná pro českou ekonomiku.",
        "2", "ČR je světovou velmocí díky [Evropské unii/Evropě]",
        "3", "Díky společnému postupu v [Evropské unii/Evropě] jsme silnějš",
        "4", "V rámci [Evropské unie/Evropě] potřebujeme posilovat odolnost",
        "5", "Když je bezpečnostně silná [Evropská unie/Evropa], tak je silné i Česko",
        "6", "Spolupráce v rámci [Evropské unie/Evropy] pomůže udržet ceny energií pod kontrolou",
        "7", "[Evropská unie/Evropa] by měla usilovat o to stát se světovým lídrem v zelených technologiích",
        "8", "[Evropská unie/Evropa] by se měla vzdát části svého blahobytu ve prospěch důslednější ochrany životního prostředí") |> 
  gt() |> 
  cols_label("item" = md("**ID**"),
             "label" = md("**Statement**")) |> 
  tab_options(table.width = pct(100),
              table.background.color = "#FFF0C1",
              table.font.size = "25px") |> 
  opt_row_striping(row_striping = TRUE) |> 
  opt_vertical_padding(scale = 2)
```

## EU Communication - Assumptions

-   Ignorability:

    -   Statement version is assigned at random -\> We can be sure it doesn't depend on the outcome

{{< newline >}}

-   SUTVA:

    -   Respondents don't know each other -\> No influence

    -   Statements are the same for everyone -\> One version of treatment

# Questions?

# InteRmezzo!

## Experimental design - concluding remarks

- Randomization by far the easiest way satisfy ignorability and SUTVA
- Sometimes it's better to randomize at the group level (e.g. schools)

{{< newline >}}

- Randomization doesn't guarantee that single estimate is accurate!
- It guarantees that the average of many estimates is accurate.

{{< newline >}}

- Precision can be improved by adding more predictors of the outcome (that are not related to the treatment)
- By far the best predictor is pre-treatment value of the outcome.
